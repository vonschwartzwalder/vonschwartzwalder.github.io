  <p>
    I grew up in rural Alaska and spent a lot of time outside. 
    Hunting, fishing, walking or running to get somewhere, or 
    shoveling snow mostly. Split a lot of wood.

    I worked as an ironworker for a while until I thought perhaps
    it was time to learn some things. What I learned was, I can
    educate myself out of a job in Alaska. After I graduated with a 
    BSEE I sent resumes everywhere and one I got back from a company
    in Alaska said "We've never hired anyone like you, and we don't
    think we ever will." I moved to the lower 48. Silicon Valley. 
    Mecca for EEs.
